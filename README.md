___

The PacMen Factory Exercise marks the conclusion of the seventh week in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development with MERN course.

## Project Overview
PacMen Factory allows users to click and add Pac-Men of random sizes to the screen. By clicking start, the Pac-Men begin bouncing around. The game can be reset at any time by clicking the reset button. This project primarily uses JavaScript.
___

## Running the Project
To run this project, clone the repository. The project consists of two main files and four images:<br>
- index.html
- pacmen.js
- images: pacman1, pacman2, pacman3, pacman4

The `index.html` file sets up the DOM buttons that trigger functions to create, move, and delete Pac-Men. The `pacmen.js` file contains the main logic, including creating an array of Pac-Men called `pacMen` and looping through this array to move them and check for collisions with the walls. The `switchImg` function changes the image of each Pac-Man based on its direction to create the illusion of movement.
